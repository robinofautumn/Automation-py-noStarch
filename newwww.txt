One of the most active areas in facial technology is facial
features such as age, gender and emotion recognition.
A lot of research has been done using deep learning
methods such as ANN, CNN to determine age, gender estimation
and emotion detection. Human Facial expression depicts
human feelings. Human tends to change feelings, perhaps
due to their mental or health conditions, in the course
of lifespan. Although people are brimming with various
feelings, modern psychology characterizes six basic facial
expressions: happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust and
anger as widespread feelings. Facial muscles exercise to assist
with perceiving individualâ€™s feelings. Fundamental facial
consideration features are eyebrows, mouth, nose and eyes.
An architecture based on the convolution Neural network
(CNN) proposed here for age, gender and emotion classification.
This is one of the well known deep artificial neural networks.
Convolutional Neural Network based design models
are broadly utilized in classification task because of their remarkable
execution in facial investigation and emotion detection.
The Convolutional Neural Network includes Feature
extraction which extracts Features corresponding to age,
gender, emotion. Furthermore CNN includes Feature classification
which classifies facial images into the correct age
group, gender and emotion such as happy, sad, angry, neutral.
